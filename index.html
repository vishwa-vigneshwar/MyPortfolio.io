            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a passionate and dedicated cybersecurity researcher with a relentless curiosity about the ever-changing digital threat landscape. My journey in the world of cybersecurity began with a fascination for technology and a deep commitment to making the digital realm safer for individuals and organizations alike.</p>
            <p>As a Cyber Security Researcher and Ethical Hacker, I am actively involved in raising cybersecurity awareness through various programs. I have been a member of the Kanchi LUG since June 2019, where we have conducted numerous awareness programs in schools and colleges around Chennai and Kanchipuram. My expertise includes Penetration Testing, Phishing, Brute Force, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, and DOS/DDOS attacks.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I am a part of the Indian Linux Users' Group - Chennai Madras since April 2020, where we focus on Linux environment installations, basics of Linux operations, and Linux networking. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering at P.T. Lee Chengalvaraya Naicker College of Engineering and Technology, expected to complete in 2025.</p>
            <p>My self-learning capability has been instrumental in my growth as a cybersecurity professional. I have a proven track record of independently acquiring new skills and knowledge in Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking, and I consistently seek out online courses, workshops, and industry forums to stay updated with the latest trends and advancements.</p>
